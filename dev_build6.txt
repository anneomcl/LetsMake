CHANGE-LOG
------------
+ Created a better teleporter script. The new teleporter script can point to a scene or to another teleporter
+ Created a loading screen system. From now on call SceneManager.LoadScene and SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync instead of
Application.LoadLevel and Application.LoadLevelAsync. The loading screen prefab is in Assets/Resources.
+ Imported Nodify(https://bitbucket.org/daemon3000/nodify), a visual scripting plugin for those who are not programmers 
- Moved the old teleporter scripts to the Obsolete folder
- Move the UIManagerScript script to the Obsolete folder and replaced it's functionality with Nodify. Open the "MainMenu" scene,
select the "MenuController" game-object and in the inspector press the "Open In Editor" botton so you can see how the same functionality 
was implemented in Nodify.
