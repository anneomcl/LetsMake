WHAT IS "LET'S MAKE"?
 
This is a community-made game using Unity3D and C#. People of all skill levels and specialties are welcome: programmers, artists, musicians, anyone. There is no plan. We don't know what it's going to look like. Everyone who wants to participate gets at least 24 hours with the project, and they can contribute whatever they want in that time.
 
HOW TO PARTICIPATE:
 
1. Enter your Twitter account username here: goo.gl/c3poBD
2. The person before you will send you a tweet with a link to a download the Unity project.
3. You have 24 hours to make your contribution, upload your project and tweet the link to the person after you. This will be the person below your username on this list: goo.gl/a64QE6
4. If you do not respond within 24 hours, I will forward your turn to the next person. If you know you will not have time to add to the project within 24 hours, please tweet to the next person ASAP so we can move more quickly.
 
SECURITY:
 
To avoid potential foul play (ie: embedding viruses or hacks within the project files), please download VirtualBox, install Unity within the virtual machine, and do your work there. If anything goes wrong, shut down the VM, and report the person who provided that download to me immediately. Your regular system should be untouched.
 
WHAT TO DO WHILE YOU WAIT:
 
Since we allow 24 hours to each person, it could take some time before you get your turn. Use it as an opportunity to learn new tools and techniques! I will be posting weekly update videos, so you can see what the game generally looks like that week, and plan out what you might want to add to it.
 
This is also a good time to practice learning Github if you are unfamiliar! It makes the uploading/downloading process much easier once you understand how it works.
 
There also may be additional "chains" in the future if there is enough backlog on the main list. Stay tuned!
 
COMMUNITY GUIDELINES:
 
The spirit of this project is to shake off all the nerves and stress of thinking about what to make, and just... doing it. With your 24 hours, you can make any contribution you want, big or small. You could drop some of your work into the Assets folder. You could make a new level. Or you could just help organize what's already there.
 
The only rule for contributions is that they are constructive and "good-spirited". Do not delete others' work or re-do it entirely. Refactoring and reorganizing is welcome, but try to make sure the intentions of the original contribution are kept.
 
If you receive a download that is inappropriately "messed with" (ie: deleting others' work, not making good-spirited contributions), let me know, and that person could be banned from making further contributions. I will then forward you the most recent download.
 
DOWNLOADING & SETTING UP:
 
1. Set up your virtual machine in whatever environment you're comfortable with.
2. Install Unity in the virtual machine.
3. Open your browser in the virtual machine and click the link you were sent.
4. If the link is from Github, you may either download it as a regular ZIP or fork the code. Please do not try forking the code if you have never used Github before. Practice using Github with a few other projects first.
5. Open the project in Unity, and make your contribution!
 
UPLOADING & PASSING YOUR TURN:
 
If you do not know how to use Github, you may upload the project to your Github account and pass on the link to your branch. If you are familiar, then send a pull request to my branch (https://github.com/anneomcl/LetsMake) and I will merge it. If I'm late in merging, that won't count into anyone's time limit. (Once again, only use Github if you are familiar!)
Once you have a link to the most recent version of the project, look up the next person, and send them a tweet including the following information: 1) A link to the project, and 2) "You have until DATE/TIME/TIMEZONE" where DATE/TIME/TIMEZONE is the time 24 hours from now. This way we can all tell when to pass on that person's turn if they don't respond.
 
CONTACTING ME:
 
I will be monitoring the sign-up sheet and Twitter. If there is any bad behavior, let me know. If you have general questions or comments, Twitter is the best place to get in touch directly.
 
However, you can also post your questions here! This is the best place to go if you have a bug, a technical question, or have general thoughts and concerns about the project. I also sincerely welcome people helping out with the process on Twitter and on this subreddit, it's always appreciated!
   
So without further ado... Let's make a game!
