Didn't do that much added a "Level timer" i think it would be fun to know how fast you could beat levels (This need to be worked on later int the game).
Started making the "Blue level".
Added tutorial text. Changed the fonts on title and game over screens.
Some useful stuff like you can close the game by pressing Esc.
