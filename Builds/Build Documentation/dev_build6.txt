- Threw some of my homemade scifi meshes on the floor, walls, and obstacles. (I know they suck, dealwithit.jpg)
- Changed the font, size, and position of the UI text to be less intrusive. Added a beware of Zombies text that disappears after 3 seconds.
- Added in a few zombies with varying animations and collision from OpenGameArt.org. 2spoopy4u.

Note: Sorry if I mucked things up a bit. This is my first time using Unity for literally anything.
